## 🧠 About Me

I work at the intersection of **code, hardware, and physics** — building systems that sense, adapt, and make decisions on the edge. My focus lies in enabling intelligence within constrained environments — microcontrollers, sensors, and physical systems — where precision, performance, and predictability are non-negotiable.

- 🔬 Specialize in **Embedded AI**,and **Entropy Systems**
- 🧱 Build devices that blend **physics, signal noise, and logic**
- 🧠 I believe that **hardware is software with voltage**
